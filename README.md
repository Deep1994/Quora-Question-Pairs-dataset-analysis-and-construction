This repository contains some analysis about the [Quora Question Pairs](https://data.quora.com/First-Quora-Dataset-Release-Question-Pairs) dataset, also how to construct train/dev/test set accoring to the raw official released dataset.

The raw official released QQP dataset contains total 404301 pairs of questions on Quora. Systems must identify whether one question is a duplicate of the other. Models are evaluated based on accuracy.

I did some analysis about the dataset, and found some typos.
